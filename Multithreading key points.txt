Multithreading
===================
Every thread has the priority inherited from its parent by default. Main thread priority is by default 5.
Green thread(Deprecated) means the thread which is completely handled by JVM without the support of underlying OS support. EX: SUN solaris is the OS which supports Green thread
Every ThreadGroup by default a child group to System(Thread.currentThread().getThreadGroup().getParent().getName())
system group contains several system level threads.(Finalizer, Reference Handler, Signal dispatcher, Attach Listener)
threadgroup.setMaxpriority() --> Threads in the thread group that have already higher priority wont be effected but for newly added threads max priority is applicable(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2L-vVpFP7Y --- Multithreading Enhancement Part- 1|| Introduction || Thread Group)
thread.stop() is deprecated and not recommended to use because for ex: if one thread has the logic of open db connection, fetch data and release connection. If this thread is stopped/killed in the middle who is responsible to release the connection means connection is wasted here.
suspend(), resume() are deprecated.
Daemon thread is a thread which runs in background to support non-daemon threads(EX: Signal dispatcher, Attach Listener, Garbage collector)
isDaemon(), setDaemon()
